# [Caramel](http://caramel.ga)

[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/lumios/caramel/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/lumios/caramel#info=devDependencies)

Caramel is a simple, modern, responsive website framework. Caramel is fully responsive, meaning you only need to write code once, to have the same results across multiple platforms. Created by [kurisubrooks](https://kurisubrooks.com), Caramel is being developed with help from the open-source community on GitHub.

## Getting Started
- [Download the latest Release](https://github.com/lumios/caramel/releases)
- [Download the latest Development Build](https://github.com/lumios/caramel/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/lumios/caramel.git```

#### Quick Start
Jump right into Caramel by using the included HTML5 Boilerplate. `template.html` is already set up to HTML5 standards, and has Caramel already included. All you need to do is to start writing your code!

Also, check out `showcase.html`, to see Caramel's latest features!

## What's included?
Our [public releases](https://github.com/lumios/caramel/releases) only contain the files that are necessary for front-end development. If you'd like to develop for, or modify Caramel, we'd recommend downloading the [Development Build](https://github.com/lumios/caramel/archive/master.zip), which includes our build tool, and the sass source files.

## Documentation

## Compiling
We've included an easy and hassle free way for you to compile Caramel. We've included our own Grunt build tool, that you can use to compile Caramel.

#### Required:
Our compiler runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed.   
Once you have Node installed, you'll need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). If you already have both Node and Grunt installed, skip these steps, otherwise install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from their website, then run the following command to install Grunt:
```
npm i grunt -g
```

#### Install:
To get the latest version of Caramel and to install the build tools, run the following set of commands:
```
cd ~/.../caramel
git clone https://github.com/lumios/caramel.git
npm i
```

#### Usage:
To run the build tool, run the following command:
```
grunt build
```

After the build is complete, the output `caramel.css`, `caramel.min.css` and `caramel.min.js` files can be found in your `./src` folder.

## Compatibility
Caramel has been designed for any browser that supports [CSS3](https://html5test.com/). Caramel has been tested, and is recommended for use on:

Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Opera | Edge | IE
:----: | :-----: | :----: | :---: | :--: | :-:
  21+  |   28+   |   7+   | 12.1+ |  20+ | 10, 11
